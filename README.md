# Inference at the Edge (C)

Trained a simple network and infered it using C (enables memory control/compute over low power devices). 

The following steps were followed: 

1) train a MLP on MNIST dataset using Pytorch
2) Build a inference engine (C) to infer the trained network

find the python script and C file containing the trainer and inference engine respectively.
