# Neural_Network_C
implemented a Multi Layer Perceptron in C with user defined architecture feature. 

Forward pass (Matrix multiplication) has been implemented on C. this allows us to run multiple trained neural nets on lower level of abstraction which can be mapped to hardware.



1) NN.cpp is under development for backward stage.
